### Project requirements

- Create a new empty repo.
- Copy your code from the project that you completed during the Admissions Trial.
- Create a new branch for your copied code.
- Open a pull request. 
- Play the role of the Code Reviewer:
    - Follow the list from the article ["How to give a code review?"](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/give_code_review_basics.md).
    - Check that you have used [semantic HTML tags](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md#:~:text=Use%20the%20appropriate%20tags%20for%20each%20element%20(e.g.%2C%20links%2C%20titles%2C%20etc.)%20and%20use%20HTML5%20semantic%20tags%20(e.g.%2C%20header%2C%20nav)%20over%20divs.).
    - Check that you applied [HTML & CSS best practices](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).
- Add as many comments as possible in the given time and finish your review. Remember to add a minimum of 2 comments.
- Copy a link to the pull request and ask for a code review in your Student Dashboard as usual. (The only difference will be that the Code Reviewer won't check your code but the review you performed - isn't it a code review inception? ;))
